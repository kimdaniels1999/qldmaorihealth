Setting up a website from scratch - free services
I have uploaded a simple template to give the client an idea of the pages and how they link

For professional services I would recommend to the client:
1. Create a unique domain name using domain providers approximate cost $4.99 USD per year
2. Use a template from free website templates example using wordpress
3. Choose a hosting provider - approximate cost $1.50 USD per month
4. Some hosting providers utilise wordpress already so makes website creation very simple
5. Remember to link the domain name to hosting provider and vise versa
